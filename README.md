# Module 10 Labs

## Part 1

### Exercise 1 (Slide 20)

- Try creating your own DockerFile for your Nodejs application (without reliance on a DB) and try creating a running image of your application. Provide your public Dockerhub image link to the trainer and they should be able to run your application using your docker image.

- To find my image, visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dtr6210/mod10e4).

### Exercise 2 (Slide 28)

- Try creating your own GitHub Actions for your Nodejs application and try creating a running CI/CD pipeline for your application that updates your Dockerhub image automatically when new commits are made.

## Part 2

### Exercise 1 (Slide 16)

- Try creating your own EC2 ubuntu instance on AWS, following the steps in the previous slides. Remember to create only a free tier server so that AWS does not charge you anything for your instance.

### Exercise 2 (Slide 25)

- Try hosting the docker image of your nodejs application that you must have created using the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that you created previously. Share the link of your hosted application to your trainer.

### Exercise 3 (Slide 42)
- Try hosting the GitHub repo of a nodejs application that you have already created, using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Choose a standalone repository with no dependencies on a database. Share the link of your hosted application with your trainer.
